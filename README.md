2. Run npm init, to initialize the npm modules in your system
3. Once you hit enter, Node.js, will ask you to enter a few details related to the project.
   These details will basically be the metadata for your project. For this project script.js, is the entry point.

5. Install JOI, npm i joi
6. Install nodemon, npm i -g nodemon (Nodemon, keeps a watch on all the files with any type of extension present in this folder.
